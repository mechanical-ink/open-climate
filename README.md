# open-climate

A resource for climate activists of all ages. Resources, projects, and initiatives that have been vetted by those active in open science and climate action. We want to acknowledge the problems, but focus on solutions. In all interactions, please adhere to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Contributing

For now, we want to collect as many resources as we can in this repository. The idea is to eventually curate these resources as a community and turn it all into a website. For now:

1. Open an issue highlighting the resource or resources you wish to add and why.
2. Once approved, add it to these README via a pull request under the relevant heading.
3. Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ty3RytTxCR).

### All We Can Save

Our mission: To nurture the leaderful climate community we need for a life-giving future. Are you hungry for deeper dialogue about the climate crisis and building community around solutions? We are too. That’s why we created All We Can Save Circles — like a book club, but a cooler, deeper, extended version. Let’s strengthen the “we” in All We Can Save. Circles were created by Dr. Katharine Wilkinson.

### Project Drawdown

Our mission is to help the world reach “drawdown”—the point in the future when levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere stop climbing and start to steadily decline, thereby halting catastrophic climate change—as quickly, safely, and equitably as possible.
